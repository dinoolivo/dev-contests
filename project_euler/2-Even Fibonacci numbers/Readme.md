# Problem
Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:
```
1,2,3,5,8,13,21,34,55,89...
```
By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed *N*, find the sum of the even-valued terms.

# Solution
In this case the solution is to spot the pattern on fibonacci even numbers: there is an even number every three positions so 
* f(0) = 0
* f(1) = 1
* **f(2) = 2**
* f(3) = 3
* f(4) = 5
* **f(5) = 8**

So the next 4 even numbers in the above sequence will be f(8), f(11), f(14).
I preferred to use iteration over recursion to compute the fibonacci sequence in order to avoid call stack overflow for big values of n in *f(n)*.
