# Problem
The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is *1<sup>2</sup> + 2<sup>2</sup> + ... + 10<sup>2</sup> = 385*. 
The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is *(1 + 2 + ... + 10)<sup>2</sup> = 55<sup>2</sup> = 3025*. 
Hence the absolute difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers and the square of the sum is *3025 - 385 = 2640*.

Find the absolute difference between the sum of the squares of the first *N* natural numbers and the square of the sum.
